                This is for June's eyes only. June, you can easily delete all traces of this blog at any time by pressing your right palm against the screen and typing: 
                Ctrl+Shift+S+F. I have no other place to write this, so I'll write it right here. For you.
            </p>

                Yesterday was your fifteenth birthday. I wish you were older though, because I can't quite bring myself to tell a fifteen-year-old girl what I found--especially
                when you should be celebrating.
            </p>
            <p class="width">
                Today I found a photograph taken by our late father. It was the very last photo album they owned, and I'd never noticed it before because Dad had hidded it behind
                a larger photo. You know I still flip through our parents' pictures all the time. I like reading their little notes, it feels like they can still talk to me. But
                this time I noticed that the last photo in that album felt unusually thick. When I fiddled with it, the secret photo fell out.
            </p>
            <p class="width">
                Dad had taken a photo of his workplace. The lab in Batalla Hall. Dad never talked to us about his work. Yet he'd taken this photo. It was blurry and oversaturated,
                but I could make out the shape of a young man on a gurney pleading for his life with a bright red biohazard sign imprinted on his hospital gown.
            </p>
            <p class="width">
                Do you know what Dad wrote at the bottom of that photo?

                I've been trying to find clues for weeks. Still nothing. Who knew the deceased civilians database was so difficult to hack?
            </p>
            <p class="width">
                But I'm not giving up yet. There's something behind our parents death, and i'm going to find out what that is.

            <h2>November 17</h2>
            <p>
                You asked me why I seemed so out of it today. June, if you're reading this, you probably remember this day, and now you'll know why.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've been hunting for clues ever since my last entry here. For the past few months I've tried asking subtle questions of other lab workers, and of Dad's old friends, 
                and searching online. Well, today I found something.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today I finally managed to hack the Los Angeles deceased civilians database. Most compicated thing I've ever done. I was going about it the wrong way. There's a
                security hole on their servers that I hadn't noticed before because they'd buried behind all sorts of--well, anyway, it resulted in me getting in. And much to my
                surprise, I actually found a report on our parents' car accident.
            </p>
            <p>
                Except it was not an accident. June, I'll never be able to say this to you out loud, so I desparately hope that you'll see it here.
            </p>
            <p>
                Commader Baccarin, another former student of Chian (you remember Chian, right?), submitted the report. The report said that Dr. Michael Iparis had roused the suspicions
                of Batalla Hall lab administrators when he questioned the true purpose of his research. He'd always worked on understanding the plague viruses, of course, but he must 
                have uncovered somthing that upset him enough to make him quietly file for a change in work assignment. Remember that, June? It was just a few weeks before the car crash.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rest of the report didn't go into the plagues, but it told me what I needed to know. June, the Batalla Hall lab administrators ordered Commander Baccarin to keep an
                eye on our father. When Dad triend to get reassigned, Baccarin knew that he'd figured out the reason for his research. As you can imagine, this didn't go over very well.
                Commander Baccarin was ordered to "find a way to smooth the whole matter over." The report ends bu saying that the matter was resolved, without military casualties.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dated a day after the car accident.
            </p>
            <p>
                They killed them.

            <h2>November 18</h2>
            <p>
                They fixed the security hole on the server. I'll have to find another way around it.

               It turns out the deceased civilians database has more information about the plagues than I guessed. Of course I should've known that, what with the plagues killing off
               hundreds of people every year. But I always thought the plagues were spontaneous. They're not. 
            </p>
            <p>
                June bug, you need to know this. I don't know when you'll find these entries, but I know you'll find them eventually. Listen to me carefully: when you are finished reading,
                don't tell me you know about anything. I don't want you doing something rash. Understand? Think about your safety first. You can find a way to help, I know you can. If
                anyone can, you can. But for my sake don't do anything that will draw attention to you. I'll kill myself if the Republic strikes you down for reacting to the knowledge that
                I gave you.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to rebel, rebel from inside the system. That's much more powerful than rebelling outside the system. And if you choose to rebel, bring me with you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dad found out taht the Republic engineers the annual plagues.
            </p>
            <p>
                They start off in the most obvious place. Those high-rise terraces full of grazing animals isn't where most of out meat comes from. Did you know that? I should"ve guessed it. 
                The Republic has thousands of underground factories for the animals. They're hundreds of feet deep. At first congress did't know what to do with the crazy viruses that kept
                developing down there and killing off entire factories of animals. Inconvenient, right? But then they remembered the Colonies was. And so every time an interesting new virus
                appears in the meat factories, the scientists take samples and craft them into viruses that can infect humans. They develop an equivalent vaccine and cure for it. And then
                they hand out madatory vaccinations to everyone but a few slum sectors. Rumor has it that there's a new strain developing in Lake and Alta and Winter.
            </p>
            <p>
                They pump that virus into the slum sectors through a series of underground pipes. Sometimes into the water supply, sometimes just directly into a few specific homes to see how
                it spreads. That starts off a new round of plague. When they think they've seen enough evidence for what that virus strain can do, they secretly prick everyone (everyone still
                alive, that is) in those sectors with the cure during a routine sweep, and the plague dies down until the next test strain. They also run induvidual plague experiments on some
                of the children who fail the Trial. The don't go to labor camps, June.
            </p>
            <p>
                None of them do.
            </p>
            <p>
                They die.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do you see where I'm going with this? They use the plagues to cull the population of weak genes, the same way the Trials pick out the strongest. But they're also creating viruses
                to use against the Colonies. They've been using biological weapons against them for years. I don't care what happens to the Colonies or exactly what out Republic wants to inflict
                upon them--but June, our own people are lab rats. Dad worked in those labs, and when he tried to quit, they killed him. And Mom. They thought they could tell everybody. Who wants
                a mass riot? Certainly not Congress.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're all going to die like this, June, if someone doesn't step in. One of these days, a virus will get out of hand, and no vaccine or cure will be able to stop it.
            </p>

            <h2>November 26</h2>

            <p>
                Thomas knows. He know what I suspect, that I think the government may have killed our parents intentionally.
            </p>
            <p>
                I keep wondering how he knew that I'd hacked the deceased civilians database, and all I can think of is that I left a trace, and the tech guys who fixed that security hole found it
                and mentioned it to him. So he approached me earlier today and asked me about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I told him I was still grieving about our parents' deaths and got a little paranoid. Told him I didn't find anything. I said you knew nothing about it, that he shouldn't mention it
                to you. He said he'd keep it a secret. I think I can trust him. It's just a little nerve-racking to have anyone know even the smallest bit about my suspicions. I mean, you know how
                he gets sometimes.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've made up my mind. By the end of the week, I'll tell Captain Jameson that I'm going to withdraw from her patrol. I'll complain about the hours and say that I don't see you enough.
                Something like that. I'll update here when I'm reassigned.
            </p>
